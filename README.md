# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify SONAR signals as either **rock** or **mine**.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow in Python, covering **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction**.

## 📌 Project Overview
SONAR signals are used to detect objects underwater. Correctly classifying whether the detected object is a **rock** or a **mine** is crucial in defense and exploration.  
This project uses supervised learning techniques to build a predictive model on the **SONAR dataset**.
